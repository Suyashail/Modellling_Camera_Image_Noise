# Modellling_Camera_Image_Noise
A short notebook for replicating noise models on camera images

This notebook is an attempt to practically understand the different noises that are introduced into the images so as to replicate the same on clean images. A brief discription of the noise followed by modelling of the same is carried out. Application of the noise on an image and its denoising techniques are also looked at.

Any additions or improvements on the code are encouraged and welcomed.
